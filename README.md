## Dataset Summary
The dataset includes hourly renewable energy generation in France from January 2020 to November 2025. It records over 51,000 observations of wind and solar power output. Each entry includes the total electricity produced in MWh, the type of energy source (wind, solar, or mixed), and important time details like date, hour, day of the year, month, day of the week, and season. Wind power makes up the majority of the records, accounting for over 80% of entries. Production levels vary from 58 to more than 23,000 MWh per hour.

## Machine Learning Problem
The machine learning problem is to forecast future hourly energy production. This is a regression or time series task that is essential for grid stability and integrating renewable energy. Other tasks include detecting anomalies, analyzing trends, and classifying sources based on time patterns.
